The code defines an Express router for handling various user-related endpoints in a backend application. The routes map to different methods in the UserController.js file, which presumably contains the logic for handling each request. Here's a summary of what each endpoint does:

POST /register: This endpoint allows a new user to register. It calls the register method in authController.

GET /getUser: This endpoint retrieves information about the currently authenticated user. It calls the getUser method in authController.

POST /login: This endpoint handles user login. It calls the login method in authController.

GET /friends/
: This endpoint retrieves the list of friends for a specific user identified by userId. It calls the getFriendsList method in authController.

POST /register_steps_user_data: This endpoint handles the registration steps for collecting additional user data. It calls the register_steps_user_data method in authController.

POST /user_terms_agree: This endpoint records the user's agreement to terms and conditions. It calls the user_terms_agree method in authController.

POST /register_submitPortfolio: This endpoint allows the user to submit their portfolio data as part of the registration process. It calls the register_user_portfolio_data method in authController.

GET /getAllUsersToHomepage: This endpoint retrieves a list of all users to display on the homepage. It calls the getAllUsersToHomepage method in authController.

GET /getUserFriendsPendinglistData: This endpoint retrieves the pending friend requests for the current user. It calls the getUserFriendsPendinglistData method in authController.

GET /getUserFriendslistData: This endpoint retrieves the confirmed friends list for the current user. It calls the getUserFriendslistData method in authController.

GET /hartings/
: This endpoint retrieves the list of "hartings" (likes or similar actions) for a specific user identified by userId. It calls the getHartingList method in authController.

Each endpoint corresponds to a specific function in the UserController.js file, which contains the implementation details for handling the respective requests.
